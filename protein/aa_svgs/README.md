## Amino acid differences
These are the SVGs for the difference between the amino acids.
Namely, the MCS is not highlighted, but the differences are.

It was done in RDKit, but as this is not always installable and there are only 400 combinations (well 200 unique) they are premade.

The code to generate it is `genererate_AA_MCS.py`.
